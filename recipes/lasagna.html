        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>This is my mom's special homemade lasagna recipe with a meaty, made-from-scratch tomato sauce and a deliciously cheesy filling.</p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>1/2 pound ground pork</li>
            <li>1/2 pound ground beef</li>
            <li>1 diced onion</li>
            <li>1 can of tomato sauce</li>
            <li>1 can of crushed tomatoes</li>
            <li>2 tablespoon of parsley</li>
            <li>1 clove of garlic</li>
            <li>dried basil</li>
            <li>dried oregano</li>
            <li>lasagna noodles</li>
            <li>parmesan</li>
            <li>cottage cheese</li>
            <li>eggs</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Cook the ground meat in a skillet until browned and crumbly. Add the onion and continue cooking until it's translucent. Stir in the canned tomato products, half of the parsley, garlic, basil, 1.5 teaspoons of salt, oregano, and sugar.</li>
            <li>Boil the lasagna noodles in lightly salted water until they're al dente.</li>
            <li>Mix cottage cheese, Parmesan cheese, eggs, the remaining parsley, the remaining salt, and pepper in a bowl.</li>
            <li>Layer the ingredients according to the recipe (starting with sauce and ending with mozzarella) until the lasagna is assembled.</li>
            <li>Cover with foil and bake in the preheated oven for about half an hour. Remove the foil and continue baking until the top is golden brown.</li>
        </ol>
